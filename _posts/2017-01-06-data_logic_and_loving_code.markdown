I never expected to let code take over my life. I think my first encounter with coding was as a bookworm child, I picked up a book on C++ and wanted to go learn it, under what impetus, I think that's been lost to history. I didn't read far enough into the book to realize the book's author expected you to have a grounding in C. This book is in a bin somewhere. 

But somehow code kept recurring in my life. I was really into computers, and I learned a bit of HTML, just to know how things worked behind the scenes. I liked videogames and in the era of the N64, using hexadecimal to program cheat codes using a GameShark just seemed like a fun thing to do with the games that I loved. I never got 'too into it' though. 

I was always a politics kid. I'd decided young that I wanted to be a social studies teacher, no, a political science professor! I went into college with the earnest idea that I'd spend most of my life teaching students about political philosophy. Along the way, you know, just some things came up. 

Those things that came up that were relevant to how I fell in love with code wasn't any lack of love for politics - I'm still passionate, I consider keeping abreast of the news, listening to philosophical podcasts about politics, and more, a hobby. It was that I was tantalized by something else. 

There were two seemingly unconnected threads that I followed out in getting BAs in Political Science and Philosophy - logic and data. 

In my Philosophy degree, I took a year of logic, I felt the joy of figuring out a long boolean's truth value, or evaluating an argument in a way beyond the traditional political discourse that so often falls into the famous movie maxim of 'well, that's just your opinion, man..'. 

In Political Science, we all got 'stuck' with a class on methodology for research. It was the most quantitatively rigorous course we had to take, and students disdained it. I'll admit, I took it twice, to improve my first not so great grade. Each time, something came up that prevented me from excelling on paper, but when it came time to crunch the data - to work in IBM SPSS doing statistical analysis - I was somehow a ringer. It was all that logic, my professor said, that they taught me over in philosophy. 

After I graduated, I bumbled around in post-undergrad ennui, trying to figure out what to do next. Somehow my mind kept coming back to coding. I started a course on Python - maybe it was codecademy, I can't honestly recall. Then, I found Ruby. Everything I read about Ruby made me really love the idea of coding in it. It's meant to be friendly to me? It's meant to sort of look like human speech? Slowly, things felt like they were demistifying, like coding was something even I could do, not some arcane process. 

I decided to start on the intro to Ruby on learn, because I really liked the platform and I'd read great things about Flatiron. And...it just clicked. I found myself wanting, really wanting to keep going and doing 'work'. I felt passion growing in myself, that line between work and satisfaction and pleasure that's so often drawn stark in our society blurring. 

When I was offered a scholarship for plowing through the intro course, I shot out an application to Flatiron on a whim. They wouldn't take me, would they? I didn't have a great, inspiring life story, I was just some kid who didn't want to be a professor anymore, who liked Ruby. Then I got my interview, against all expectations, and said what I've basically said here - I was falling in love with code without knowing it. I was getting data and logic and the joy of using and manipulating them, before I thought to properly pursue coding. 

Now here I am. Brought by a recurring thread, by disparate elements, to code. To all the good and the bad. To banging my head against a wall trying to figure out why code I wrote isn't working, to the exultant moment when I figure out the (usually simple) fix, or find a better, more elegant way to do something. 

Wouldn't change it for the world.
