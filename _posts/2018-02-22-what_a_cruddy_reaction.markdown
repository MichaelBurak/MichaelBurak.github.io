# WORKING TITLE
intro
-
## SECTION 1 - PROJECT
- what this section is about
	-LIST OF Original ideas 
	-Settled on more basic  app to work on fundamentals 
	-Notepad as EverNote is a beloved app and inspiration, but much simpler. Aimed to do Autosave.
	-General CRUD Structure of app. Create reading updating deleting Notes.
- why it matters
	-CRUD is super important , it’s basically all we do with data/all we do at all.
	-A simple app in my opinion can be beautifully coded and a lot learned form making one , also they evolve complexity from simplicity as you think of new things to implement vs. taking on a huge project at once.
	-Culminating with a simple project vs. one I would rabbit hole on is prep for workplace and focusing on discrete tasks and desired output.
- research or examples
	-Early code snippets from early commits 
- takeaways
	-Beginning to build a simple app can be daunting(blank page syndrome)
	-Did a CRUD app as CRUD seems essential and can (as seen in future sections) be a little complex in React/Redux. 
## SECTION 2 - PROCESS
- what this section is about
	-Evolution of the project, look over how code has changed, read many commits and describe general flow. 
	-Mention wrangling with autosave as a ‘neat feature’ but not ‘essential’
	-How much this taught me about React + Redux.
- why it matters
	-Building an app from scratch is a time tested way to better learn a language and this bore fruit. 
- research or examples
	-On learning: handling state and props better throughout project
	-On learning: Implementing proper action/reducer interactions and proper Redux state management
	-On learning: Timeouts and JS timing with autosave attempts.
- takeaways
	-Learned [specific things] about React + Redux and wiring front and backend with it. 
	-Saw the importance of prioritizing core features over ’neat features’ 
	-React + Redux may be a framework but it is a JS framework and working with it helped me understand JS more, such as ‘this’
## SECTION 3 - PROJECT
- what this section is about
	-Ended up with a elegant CRUD app 
	-Did not include some features to be added later for simplicity and to focus on React + Redux knowledge vs. say wrangling with Devise in Rails for authentication(do not have authentication/users/admins/etc.)
	-Autosave might not even be a thing after all. And that’s okay. Maybe later.
- why it matters
	-CRUD apps and implementing CRUD properly demonstrate coding proficiency in a language. 
	-A simple app can expose coding strengths and vulnerabilities through being easier to read. (Note comments.)
	-In the end, development in the workplace has deadlines and important features and the like, stuff like autosave isn’t crucial unless it is.
- research or examples
	-Finished code snippets to compare directly to earlier code snippets
	-Link to walkthrough video 
- takeaways
	-I found designing even a simple CRUD app in an evolving language like React to have its own enlightening and occasionally frustrating moments. 
	-Much was learned about React and JS. 
	-Between React, Redux, Rails, JS, CSS, HTML and DB interactions, it was a big culmination of everything learned at Flatiron.
