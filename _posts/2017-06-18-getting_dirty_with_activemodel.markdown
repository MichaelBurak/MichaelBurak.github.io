Something very important to any Rails application is one's models. The ways they associate, methods that belong to them, how they communicate in the great circle of life that is the request cycle of the MVC framework of Rails...and their attributes. 

For my Rails project at Flatiron School, I've been working on a Rails app designed to model making characters for a role-playing game and leveling them up through events that happen to them. The actual leveling up evolved over time in the application. As the characters were meant to level up and increase in attributes every time they crossed a threshold of 100 xp, the original implementation of leveling up was pretty simple:

```
def add_event_xp
    self.xp += planner.events.last.xp
    until self.xp < 99
      level_up
    end
    self.save
  end

  def level_up
    self.level += 1
    self.xp -= 100
    self.subtle += rand(1..10)
    self.powerful += rand(1..10)
    self.resistant += rand(1..10)
  end
end
```


This would add the xp gained from the last event in the character's planner, which holds the events that can happen to them, and level them up for every 100xp they had, leaving the remainder. Their attributes representing what the character was capable of - how subtle, powerful and resistant they were - would go up by a random number between one and ten. 

But...this didn't feel like enough. It was neat, but it didn't challenge my understanding of anything in Rails, and what I really secretly yearned for was this: when characters level up, they get a pool of 30 points to distribute among those 3 attributes, and can't raise them any higher. This would give the user choice, instead of a random increase in the attributes at hand. 

That's when I started searching around for ways to track attribute changes, to make a system that could check to see if attributes had changed by too much. I found the answer in [ActiveModel:Dirty](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html), specifically in the changes method. 

I made some missteps at first - I really should have been using a counter, but instead I set each change in the individual attributes to a variable, then added them all up and threw up an error if they were above 30. Because changes returns a value of an array, something like [1900, 2000] if one increased an attribute from 1900 to 2000, my code would have to return the difference. This was simple, an example from my code: 

```
subtle_change = subtle[1] - subtle[0] 

And then at the end of the method-

if subtle_change + powerful_change + resistant_change > 30 
self.errors.add(:level, "Can't increase attributes by more than 30")
```

However, if changes were not executed on one of the three attributes, this look for the change would return nil, preventing the method from working. Instead, I eventually settled on passing the event through the method, assigning a value of 30 to an attribute representing spendable points each time a character leveled up, and checking if the attributes have changed using an if statement. This would form the core of the validation.


```
def validate_leveling_up
    total = 0
    subtle = self.changes[:subtle]
    powerful = self.changes[:powerful]
    resistant = self.changes[:resistant]
    if self.subtle_changed?
      subtle_change = subtle[1] - subtle[0]
      total += subtle_change
    end
    if self.powerful_changed?
      powerful_change = powerful[1] - powerful[0]
      total += powerful_change
    end
    if self.resistant_changed?
      resistant_change = resistant[1] - resistant[0]
      total += resistant_change
    end
    if total <= self.spendable_points
      self.spendable_points -= total
    else
      self.errors.add(:base, "Can't increase attributes by more than 30 per level added")
    end
  end
```
	
	This is when I learned more about validations than I was expecting. Specifically, that validations trigger when attributes are changed(not terribly new knowledge, but something I didn't fully expect the implications of), and that there's many ways of limiting them. Without additional changes, this lead to the very thorny situation that validating leveling up would trigger on the update action, including just editing a character. As I wanted users to be able to edit characters in a more free way in addition to leveling them up, I had to find a workaround. 
	
To do this, I would confirm that a character had just leveled up, and explicitly not trigger the validation on a regular update action. 

In my model, I added this method: 

```
def just_leveled_up?
    spendable_points > 0
  end
```
	
Additionally, I set an attribute accessor to call upon in the controller to skip the validation. 

```
attr_accessor :skip_level_validation
```


In my controller, I set up actions to add experience to a character, select their attributes(including calling an attribute_ceiling method which would represent and display how much a user could raise attributes by), and level up, along with skipping the validation on a regular update.

```
def update
    @character.skip_level_validation = true
      if @character.update(character_params)
        redirect_to @character, notice: 'Character was successfully updated.'
      else
        render :edit
      end
    end
		
		def experience
    event = Event.find(params[:event])
    if @character.add_event_xp(event)
      if @character.just_leveled_up?
      redirect_to character_attributes_path
    else
      redirect_to @character
    end
  end
  end

    def attribute_selection
      @character.attribute_ceiling
    end

    def level_up
      if @character.update(character_params)
        redirect_to @character, notice: 'Character was successfully updated.'
      else
        render 'attribute_selection'
      end
    end
```
		
In the end, the validation itself looked like this:

```
validate :validate_leveling_up, :on => :update, if: :just_leveled_up?,
           unless: :skip_level_validation
```

In conclusion, ActiveModel:Dirty allows for the tracking of attributes, and was essential to implementing a much-desired feature in my app. This simple leveling up system limited by the amount one can change attributes by could be expanded or modified in different ways, but provides an example of the power of ActiveModel:Dirty's tracking of changes, something I didn't know about and wasn't expecting to use before starting this project. 

Special thanks to Avi Flombaum for confirming I was on the right track in getting Dirty with Rails and providing some sample code that I used to figure out how to accomplish this functionality, especially that it would be a validator, as I hadn't worked much with custom validators before and I also learned a lot about validation in the process.
